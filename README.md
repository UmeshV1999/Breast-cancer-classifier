Breast Cancer Dataset is available at(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone.
It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control.
These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.
Machine Learning technique can dramatically improve the level of diagnosis in breast cancer. 
Research shows that experienced physicians can detect cancer by 79% accuracy, while a 91 %( sometimes up to 97%) accuracy can be achieved using Machine Learning techniques.
